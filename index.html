                                <p> I know basic... but you have start somewhere. I can create simple website like this. Still learning and improving this topic.

                                <p>Love to have fun with this one. I am creative and changing styles, fonts, colors etc. are the most fun for me. Interesting fact! - I spent 3 hours of my time to do perfect (in my opinion) button, let's say I am really patient with this kind of stuff. </p>

                               <p> It can really make your job easier so I like to use it. You can say i know basics Javascript it's really wide topic so you spend whole days knowing new stuff.</p>

                            <h3 class="skill-title">BOOTSTRAP</h3>
                            <p> Sometimes it is good to know how to use it. Simple solutions are sometimes better so it's good to know the skills. I can read the library and make website using bootstrap - some people do not like it but for me it's just easier sometimes to use it.</p>
